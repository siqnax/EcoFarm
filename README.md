# EcoFarm AI - Sustainable Agriculture Dashboard

![EcoFarm AI Dashboard](assets/screenshot.png)

EcoFarm AI is an AI-powered sustainable agriculture platform that helps farmers optimize crop yields while minimizing environmental impact. This project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by addressing food security, water conservation, and climate action through innovative AI technologies.

## Features

- üå± **Crop Disease Detection**: Upload crop images to identify diseases using TensorFlow.js
- üåæ **AI Crop Recommendations**: Get personalized crop suggestions based on soil, climate, and water conditions
- üíß **Water Conservation Analytics**: Visualize water savings through optimized irrigation
- üåç **Sustainability Impact Dashboard**: Track contributions to UN SDGs
- üìä **Environmental Impact Visualization**: Interactive charts for emissions reduction and yield improvement
- üì• **Export Functionality**: Generate PDF reports of dashboard analytics
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js, MobileNet
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF, html2canvas
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Design**: Modern UI with sustainability-focused color scheme

# Live Demo

 (Note: For best performance, open in Chrome)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siqnax/EcoFarm.git
cd ecofarm-ai
```

**2. Open the project:**
```bash
# No installation required - just open index.html in your browser
open index.html
```

**3. Start using the application:** 
- Upload crop images for disease detection
- Select farming conditions for crop recommendations
- Explore sustainability metrics and charts
- Export reports as PDF

## How It Works

### Crop Disease Detection
1. Upload an image of crop leaves
2. AI analyzes the image using TensorFlow.js and MobileNet
3. Get instant diagnosis with confidence level
4. Receive treatment recommendations

### Crop Recommendations
1. Select your soil type (Loamy, Sandy, Clay, Silty)
2. Choose your climate zone (Tropical, Dry, Temperate, Continental)
3. Specify water availability (High, Medium, Low)
4. Get AI-powered crop suggestions and water management tips

### Sustainability Dashboard
- Visualize water savings through optimized irrigation
- Track reduction in crop diseases over time
- Monitor CO2 emissions reduction by source
- Compare traditional vs. AI-enhanced crop yields
